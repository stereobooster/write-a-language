# Calcy + call-by-name

To run CLI REPL

```sh
node index.js
```

> Pass/Call-by-name.â‹† A less common method is to transmit the expression in the actual parameter list unevaluated, and let the call function evaluate them as needed using eval.
> The programmer may specify transmission by name using `nlambda` in place of lambda in the function definition.
